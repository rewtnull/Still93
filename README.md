Still 93 - A Cyber AI Mega Demo released at Evoke 2023
------------------------------------------------------

A Demo Scene production released at the Evoke Demo Party in Cologne,
shared 10th place in the PC Demo competition.

This is a digital art project that was worked on between early March and Late July of 2023.

It is meant to be partly satirical and partly a love letter to the people in the early days
of the Demo Scene.

The overall theme, attitude, choice of effects, pacing, music, length of demo etc, is meant
to reflect the feel of those early days; the angst felt by and naivity of the youth of this
sub culture back then.

Still 93 was coded 100% by the free version of ChatGPT and there is not a single piece of code
that has been coded by me or anyone else in the team.

This choice ties in to the theme with "early days", as we are only in the beginning of the
AI revolution so I wanted my first ever demo to combine the old with the new.

What has been done by me regarding the code:

- Copy & Pasting code to reuse in other places
- Renaming variables, functions etc.
- Tweaking parameters
- Scroll text contents, greetings and so on... 

Even though this has been a difficult and time consuming project, I can still not take
credits for the programming as I could not tell from what sources ChatGPT has pulled code.
I Want to send out a BIG thank you to all unknown people who through ChatGPT have contributed
to this project!

There is also a hidden social commentary, but I will let you figure that part out by
yourselves.
